# Jenkins Pipeline Tutorial with JDK, Maven, SonarQube, and Docker Integration

This tutorial walks you through setting up a Jenkins pipeline using a `Jenkinsfile` to automate the build, test, and deployment process for a Java application. The pipeline includes integration with the Java Development Kit (JDK), Maven for build and dependency management, SonarQube for code analysis, and Docker for containerization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following components and tools installed and configured:

1. **Jenkins**: Install and set up Jenkins on your server. You can follow the official documentation [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have a JDK installed on your Jenkins server. You can download and install it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

3. **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed on your Jenkins server. You can download it from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions.

4. **SonarQube**: Set up a SonarQube server for code analysis. Follow the official documentation [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/).

5. **Docker**: Install Docker on your Jenkins server for containerization. You can follow the installation instructions for your specific platform on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

1. Fork or clone a repository to your local machine or Jenkins server.

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job:
   - Open Jenkins and select "New Item."
   - Choose "Pipeline" as the job type and give it a name.

3. In the pipeline configuration:
   - Under the "Pipeline" section, select "Pipeline script from SCM" as the Definition.
   - Choose your version control system (e.g., Git) and provide the repository URL.
   - Specify the branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the path to the `Jenkinsfile` in the repository.

4. Save the job configuration.

## Jenkinsfile

The `Jenkinsfile` in this repository defines the stages of the pipeline:

1. **Checkout**: This stage checks out the source code from your Git repository.

2. **Build and Test (Maven)**: This stage builds the Java application using Maven and runs tests.

3. **SonarQube Analysis**: This stage analyzes the code using SonarQube. Make sure to configure SonarQube server credentials in Jenkins.

4. **Build Docker Image**: This stage builds a Docker image of your Java application.

5. **Push Docker Image**: This stage pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub). Configure Docker registry credentials in Jenkins.

6. **Deploy Docker Container**: This stage deploys the Docker container to a Docker host.

## Running the Pipeline

- Trigger the pipeline manually or set up a webhook or schedule to run it automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository.

- The pipeline will execute each stage sequentially and report the status of each step in the Jenkins job console.

## Conclusion

This Jenkins pipeline tutorial demonstrates how to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Java application.

Feel free to explore and adapt this setup to your needs, and don't forget to secure your credentials and secrets in Jenkins for a production environment.
